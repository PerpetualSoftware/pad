// paneMintSettle — coalesces rapid popstate-driven `?item=` changes (a HELD
// browser Back/Forward) into a single collab teardown/mint for the split
// pane's `<ItemDetail>` instance (PLAN-2154 Architecture D).
//
// Every `?item=` change re-drives ItemDetail's `loadData`/`collabKey`
// effects (destroy the old Y.Doc/WS provider, mint a fresh one, replay the
// op-log) — cheap for a single deliberate open/drill/close, expensive when a
// user holds Back/Forward and the browser fires a `popstate` per history
// entry traversed. `j`/`k` pane-follow already protects the same mint path
// with a ~140ms debounce (`PANE_FOLLOW_DEBOUNCE_MS`, `[collection]/+page.svelte`),
// but popstate bypasses that entirely — it flows straight through
// `beforeNavigate`'s same-pathname early return to the `openItemRef`
// derived. This module is the popstate-side mirror of that same coalescing.
//
// Direct actions (`openItemPane`/`navigatePaneTo`/`closeItemPane` — a `goto`
// push/replace, `nav.type !== 'popstate'`) apply IMMEDIATELY: they're
// already a single deliberate action, not a burst, and delaying one would
// only add latency users would notice. A popstate landing on a CLOSED pane
// (`ref === null`) also applies immediately, never settled: the pane's
// mount boundary (`{#if openItemRef}` in `+page.svelte`) already reacts to
// the raw URL instantly, tearing the `<ItemDetail>` down the moment the URL
// loses `?item=`. If the null were delayed instead, a quick close-then-
// reopen within the settle window (Back to close, Forward to reopen) would
// remount `<ItemDetail>` against the STALE pre-close `paneMintRef` — wrong
// content, and a wasted mint on top of the correct one that follows. Only a
// popstate settling on a NON-null ref during an already-open pane settles.
//
// Framework-agnostic (no `$state`/`page`/`goto`) so it's unit-testable with
// vitest fake timers without mounting the route — same pattern as
// `contentSaver.svelte.ts` and `paneController.ts`.
